# FoodApp

Personal project to familiarize myself with navigation within a React Native application.

# Some notes

1. navigate/push, pop/goBack, popToTop (back to root), replace (new stack - no back)
2. passing parameters between screens
3. setting navigation options to edit header styling
4. use ImageBackground from react-native to implement background images
