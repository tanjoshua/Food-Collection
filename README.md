# Food Collection App

Personal project to familiarize myself with navigation within a React Native application.

# Some notes

1. navigate/push, pop/goBack, popToTop (back to root), replace (new stack - no back)
2. passing parameters between screens
3. setting navigation options to edit header styling - both in a function and as an object
4. use ImageBackground from react-native to implement background images
5. use react-navigation-header-buttons to add buttons to headers
6. use react-navigation-tabs to create a navigation tab - tabBarOptions to style navigation bar and navigationOptions in constructor to add icons
7. nest stack navigator in tab navigator for organization of pages
8. Additional navigation: drawer navigator - use navigationOptions to create the hamburger button
